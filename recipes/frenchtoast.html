<h4>This is a plate of chocolate orange French toast.</h4>
<p>Now <em>normally</em> I am not one to mix fruit with pleasure...<em>but</em> this baby changed my mind I'll be honest.</p>
<h2 class="othertitles">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 thick slices of brioche, challah or panettone</li>
        <li>2 tbsp marmalade</li>
        <li>40g dark chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>300ml whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extrac</li>
        <li>1 orange, zested, then peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>icing sugar, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="othertitles">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1. Cut a pocket into the side of each thick slice of bread using a small, sharp knife, then spoon in a quarter of the marmalade and poke a quarter of the chocolate into each pocket.</li>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, milk, vanilla, orange zest and cinnamon together in a shallow dish. Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, making sure both sides are fully coated.</li>
        <li>Melt 1/2 tbsp of the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Lay a soaked bread slice in the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 mins per side. Repeat with the remaining slices. Keep the toasted slices warm in a low oven while cooking the next, adding more butter as needed.</li>
        <li>Put the orange slices in a pan with the maple syrup and warm through over a low-medium heat until some of their juices are released. Dust the French toast with icing sugar and top with the yogurt, orange slices and warm maple-orange syrup.</li>
    </ol>
